1) java script if block doesn't take boolean values. it take either truthy or falsy values.

eg -> falsy values -

null
undefined
0
false
""

these are falsy values, and if one of this is a if condition, than in this case control will always got to else block.

other than this all other values are truthy values eg ->

1,2,2.2,-2.2,"vedant","abc" etc.

* in java script we can make truthy and falsy values as conditions.
